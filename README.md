<h1>Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz</h1>
<h2>Polymorphism</h2>

<h3>What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?</h3>

<p>The word polymorphism means that something can take on many forms or shapes.</p> 

<h3>What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.</h3>

<p>When we apply the concept of polymorphism to OO design in Java we can allow objects of different classes to be manipulated based on the enforced methods require from the implementation of an interface. For example, objects which are instances of classes with varying attributes and methods can be handled with regard to their simularity with the interface acting as a contract that they will have a funtion of a certain name with a set type of return. This increases the flexibility of the program and reduces rigiditiy and fragility.</p>

<h3>What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?</h3>

<p>We can use Interface in java to implement polymorphism in Java.</p>

<h3>How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?</h3>

<p>The object could take on infinite forms.</p>

<h3>Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.</h3>

<p>Polymorphism could be used when there is a requirement for a collection of objects of different classes to be held in a data structure such as an ArrayList of HashMap.

<h2>Composition</h2>

<h3>What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?</h3>

<p>Composition is a methodology for design software programs in which objects are created with a HAS-A relationship to other objects. This moves away from the Inheritance priniciple which has the capacity to create issues as a program develops. Composition is a form of futureproofing and increases flexibility.

<h3>When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.</h3>

<p>Composition would be used in any project using a object oriented programming language.</p>

<h3>What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?</h3>

<p>Composition helps to make code more robust and future proofs it by reducing hi level dependencies on lo level modules allowing changes to be made without "breaking" the code. This also lends itself to reusing code. </p>

<h3>What happens to the behaviours when the object composed of them is destroyed?</h3>
